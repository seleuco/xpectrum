**gp2Xpectrum**

> This emulator is the result from the work of many people, which we'll mention here:
**Main emulator authors are:**
> > - Hermes/PS2R: Did the original port for GP2X from GP32's fzx32.


> - Metalbrain: Many improvements, mainly on CPU, timings and screen emulation accuracy.

> - Seleuco: Many improvements, mainly on sound and tape support.

> - SplinterGU: SDL code & improved the load screen.

**The following people contributed with patches:**
> - kounch: TV-out scale patch.

> - GnoStiC: USB joystick patch.

**Generic GP2X code is also used, from:**
> - rlyeh: his minimal library was used in old versions, and the current micro lib has been created partly thanks to his findings.

> - Squidge: MMU hack

> - Puck2099: USB joystick library.

> - notaz: code to flush the uppermem cache.

**And last but not least, GP2Xpectrum has used code from many other open source projects, whose authors we should also name:**

> - rlyeh (again): creator of fzx32 for the GP32 console.

> - Santiago Romero: creator of ASpectrum emulator, which was the base for fzx32.

> - Philip Kendall, Darren Salt, Witold Filipczyk, Fredrick Meunier and Matan Ziv-Av: creators of FUSE emulator, where our sound code (and also some z80 emulation bits) comes from, and its companion library libspectrum (used to add TZX support).

> - James McKay: Creator of X128 emulator.

> - Ulrich Doewich: Creator of Caprice, an Amstrad CPC emulator, from which the code for the +3 disk unit was taken.

> - Sergey Bulba: Creator of the utility AY2SNA.

> - Julian R Seward: Creator of BZIP.

> - Dieter Baron and Thomas Klausner: Creators of LIBZIP.
